using dot = uu[o] * dx and ignoring vv[o]*dy, uint16_t fixedpt and floatpt give same best_ori.
it seems like the differences between fixedpt and floatpt happen mostly near +255 and -255. (even with int32 instead of int16)

using dot=uu[o]*dx + vv[o]*dy, and multiplying uu,vv by 100...
 int16: there are ~11000 mismatches out of 512*512=262144 entries.
 int32: there are ~7000 mismatches

multiplying uu,vv by 1000...
 int32: there are ~650 mismatches

multiplying uu,vv by 10000...
 int32: there are ~250 mismatches, and all of them are where dx=0


voc5 float vs FFLD LUT...
 ~6000 mismatches. many of these are bin 0 vs bin 18.
